# content

put all your markdown files here.

- all markdown files must begin with two digits and a dash (`-`). 
- prepended digits with a value < 10 will not be included in the paper (except a special one called `00-abstract.md`)
- other than that you can name the files anything you want
- files will be ordered by the prepended digits.
