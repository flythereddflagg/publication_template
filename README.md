# PUBLICATION TEMPLATE
## SUPER AWESOME TITLE FOR YOUR PUBLICATION!

The repository for the paper

(Intended for windows users) To use this you will need:

- [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) (to install and manage the following):
  - typora (to write in markdown)
  - pandoc (to convert from markdown and tex)
  - python (To automate pandoc conversion)
  - latex (to convert from tex to pdf)
  - sumatrapdf (to display the pdf dynamically)
  - make (to automate all of this)

The powershell script `install_software.ps1` can do all this for you. Just run it in powershell and answer 'a' to the permission questions.

Good luck! Input and contributions welcome!
